    <p>The purpose of this page is to Create, Read, Update and Delete the displayed data, previously generated by the user prompted partial name query within the drop-down box. In this scenario being Employees, Positions and Programs. However in this instance, Employees can not be permanently deleted from the database. Instead they posses a nullable varible called "ReleaseDate", that will be implemented to reflect their abscence relating to the school. I am to create a unmapped property called FullName, and the string must return the LastName and FirstName of the employee. The form will allow users to select and view the position and program from a list of data currently on the database.</p>
